# Baybayin-Translator
A Baybayin translator is a tool or system that converts modern Filipino text into Baybayin, the ancient script used in the Philippines before Spanish colonization. While Baybayin was largely replaced by the Latin alphabet, it has seen a resurgence in recent years due to cultural revival efforts.
